The genus name tells us which grouping the species belongs to and thus how it is related to other similar species.  For example, the wolf is known as

Placing these species into groupings in an overall "tree of life" is part of what scientists called "taxonomists" get to do! When your browse the Encyclopedia of Life, you can use the "classification browser" on the right side of the species pages to browse the tree of life.
47. /home/jrice/code/eol/app/views/games/identify_the_image.html.haml line:121 found: Taxonomists also discover new species and then give them a new species name and possibly a new genus name if a home for it can't be found in any other existing group.  Scientists write names according to pre-established rules, but over the years, some names have been used more than once or have changed over time, which makes it harder to find what you are looking for.  Technology is helping us solve these problems and prevent from happening with new species by drawing the links between names and information.  The Encyclopedia of Life is built to allow all this information to be collected on one page regardless of the name being referred to, be it "Canis lupus", "wolf", "loup" or any other language you can think of.
