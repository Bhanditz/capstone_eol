qqq:
  a_data_object: "A data object is any kind of media which is not more specifically identifiable (ie: NOT an image, map, video, or sound.)"
  by_scientific_name_table_header: "This is a table header which sometimes appears immediately after a separate table header that reads \"Search\".  It is meant to indicate a second column where a link will be provided to search by the scientific name of the taxon (rather than the common name or some synonym)."
  cannot_be_associated_with_both_a_user_and_a_community: this is an error message which will almost never appear, wherein a collection was associated with both a user and community. This is wrong because a collection can only be created by one or the other.
