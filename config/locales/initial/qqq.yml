  cannot_be_associated_with_both_a_user_and_a_community: "this is an error message which will almost never appear, wherein a collection was associated with both a user and community. This is wrong because a collection can only be created by one or the other."
  cannot_index_collection_item_type_error: "Yes, there is a problem here with the gender/etc of the 'type' argument.  But this is a RARE error (it should really never show up, since it means some new kind of object was introduced to the code) and thus we don't really mind if the error here isn't perfect."
  create_community: "This is a button label and is not meant to be (fully) grammatical."
  max_collection_items_error: "This wil never, ever be a small number... always at least 500."
  never: "This is in regards to the frequency at which the user will receive email.  Thus, this case, it means 'never, ever', not 'never been'."

  rank_recognized_by_agent: "This resolves in a format similar to this: \"Species recognized by Integrated Taxonomic Information System:\".  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  rank_recognized_by_agent_colon: "This resolves to something similar to this: \"Taxon recognized by IUCN:\", and acts as the header to a navigatable tree of life, showing the relationships between various levels of taxa."
  rank_recognized_by_from_source: "This can resolve in a format similar to this: \"Species recognized by Integrated Taxonomic Information System and T Orrell (custodian) in Catalogue of Life:\".  where the \"and\" was inserted between two values for the \"agent\" variable.  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."

In the latter case, this entry would be seen as a paragraph under a header named \"Recognized by\".

  recognized_by_from_source_as_a_rank: "This entry would be seen as a paragraph under a header named \"Recognized by\".  These can get more complex, as occasionally the values are created with Rails' #to_sentence method.  Thus, you can end up with \"The Integrated Taxonomic Information System and T Orrell (custodian) in Catalogue of Life as a Taxon\", where the \"and\" was inserted between two values for the \"recognized_by\" variable.  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
