  page_statistics_explanation: "<p>EOL automatically calculates some statistics about its pages. These statistics recalculate [how often]?</p><h5>Richness Score</h5><p>Richness Score is a composite of many different factors such as:<ul><li>how much text a page has</li><li>how many multimedia or map files are available</li><li>how many different topics are covered</li><li>how many different sources contribute information</li></ul></p><p>In addition, we consider whether the information has been reviewed or not. If a page already has a lot of multimedia or text, it may not increase the Richness Score to add more.</p><p>The Richness Score ranges from 0 to 100, where richer pages have higher scores. Don’t worry, differences in Richness Scores of a few points are probably not very important. Over time we may change the way we calculate this score to better reflect your experience with the site. Be sure to let us know what you think by leaving a comment on pages you think we’ve misjudged.</p><h5>Trusted Images</h5><p>Includes all trusted images for this page and pages that appear in a classification below this page. This number includes both images that came from trusted partners as well as images coming from partners such as Flickr or Wikimedia Commons that have been trusted by an EOL curator.</p><h5>Unreviewed Images</h5><p>Includes all unreviewed images for this page and pages that appear in a classification below this page. Some of our partners provide large numbers of high quality images that may be better than the ones that are trusted but simply haven’t been reviewed yet. It does not include images that have been untrusted by an EOL curator.</p><h5>Trusted Articles</h5><p>Includes all trusted text articles on the details tab of this page and several articles on the resources tab. This number includes text articles that came from trusted partners. It also includes articles directly contributed to EOL by its members or from Wikipedia that have been trusted by an EOL curator. It does not include articles on pages that appear in a classification below this page.</p><h5>Unreviewed Articles</h5><p>Includes all unreviewed text articles on the details tab of this page and several articles on the resources tab. This number includes text articles directly contributed to EOL by its members or from Wikipedia that are waiting for review by an EOL curator. It does not include articles on pages that appear in a classification below this page."
